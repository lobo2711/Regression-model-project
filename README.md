# Linear Regression Project – Predictive Modeling
📌 Project Overview

This project applies Linear Regression to explore relationships between variables and build a predictive model. The goal was to understand how independent factors influence an outcome and demonstrate how regression can be used in business decision-making.

## 🎯 Objectives

Apply linear regression to model relationships between variables.

Interpret regression coefficients to understand impact factors.

Evaluate model accuracy and limitations.

Present insights in a clear, visual, and actionable way.

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset includes quantitative variables relevant for prediction (e.g., sales, advertising spend, or customer behavior indicators). It was cleaned and prepared before modeling to ensure accuracy adn it has been uploaded here.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

Python

Pandas → data manipulation

Matplotlib & Seaborn → visualization

Scikit-learn → linear regression modeling & evaluation

Jupyter Notebook → project environment

## 🔎 Key Steps

Data Cleaning & Preparation – handling missing values and formatting data.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – identifying correlations and patterns.

Modeling with Linear Regression – fitting and training the model.

Evaluation – checking R², error metrics, and visualizing residuals.

Insights & Conclusions – interpreting coefficients and suggesting business applications.

## 📈 Results & Insights

The regression model captured clear relationships between variables.

Certain predictors showed strong influence on the outcome, while others were less significant.

Model evaluation metrics highlight where regression works well and where improvements are possible.

## 🚀 How to Use

Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/lobo2711/Regression-model-project.git


Open the notebook in Jupyter:

jupyter notebook "Proyecto_RegresionLineal.ipynb"


Run the notebook to reproduce results.
